    <h2>Song by Ed Sheeran</h2>

    <p><b>
        When your legs don t work
        When your legs don't work like they used to before<br>
        And I can't sweep you off of your feet<br>
        Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love<br>
        Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks<br></p>


    <p> And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70<br>
        And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23<br>
        And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
        Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>
        Oh me I fall in love with you every single day<br>
        And I just wanna tell you I am<br></p>

    <p> So honey now<br>
        Take me into your loving arms<br>
        Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
        Place your head on my beating heart<br>
        I'm thinking out loud<br>
        Maybe we found love right where we are<br>
        When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades<br>
        And the crowds don't remember my name<br>
        When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm<br>
        I know you will still love me the same<br>
        'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen<br>
        Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory<br>
        I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
        Maybe it's all part of a plan<br>
        I'll just keep on making the same mistakes<br>
        Hoping that you'll understand<br></p>

    <p> But baby now<br>
        Take me into your loving arms<br>
        Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
        Place your head on my beating heart<br>
        I'm thinking out loud<br>
        That maybe we found love right where we are, oh<br>
        So baby now<br>
        Take me into your loving arms<br>
        Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
        Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart<br>
        I'm thinking out loud<br>
        That maybe we found love right where we are<br>
        Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)<br>
        And we found love right where we are<br></b></p>
